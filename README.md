# Singleton design pattern
 is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In other words, it restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object, which can be accessed from anywhere in the application. This pattern is commonly used when you need to manage a shared resource, configuration settings, or a global state in a controlled manner.
